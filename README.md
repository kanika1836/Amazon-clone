This project is a static Amazon homepage clone built using HTML and CSS. It replicates the layout, design, and structure of the original site, including a header with navigation, a search bar, product listings, banners, and a footer. The focus was on mastering front-end development basics like semantic HTML, CSS Flexbox/Grid, and responsive design. Although non-functional, the clone demonstrates strong UI design skills and attention to detail, serving as a solid foundation for future dynamic web development.
